# 📝 Project Title: COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📖 Project Description

This project builds a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks **global COVID-19 trends**. It focuses on analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries over time. Learners will work with real-world data, clean and process it, perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and generate visual reports using Python tools.

By the end, you’ll have a complete data analysis report with visuals and insights—ready for presentation or publishing.

## 🚩 Project Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
- ✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report

---

## 🗂️ Project Segments (Step-by-Step Guide)

### 1️⃣ Data Collection

**Goal:** Obtain a reliable COVID-19 dataset.

**Data Sources:**
- Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 Dataset: [OWID GitHub](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
- Johns Hopkins University GitHub Repository

**✅ Recommended Action:**
Download `owid-covid-data.csv` and save it in your working folder.

---

### 2️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration

**Goal:** Load the dataset and explore its structure.

**Tasks:**
- Load data using `pandas.read_csv()`
- View columns: `df.columns`
- Preview rows: `df.head()`
- Identify missing values: `df.isnull().sum()`

**Key Columns:** `date`, `location`, `total_cases`, `total_deaths`, `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `total_vaccinations`, etc.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

**Goal:** Prepare data for analysis.

**Tasks:**
- Filter selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Drop rows with missing critical values
- Convert `date` column to datetime
- Handle missing values with `fillna()` or `interpolate()`

---

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Goal:** Understand the data through statistics and trends.

**Tasks:**
- Plot total cases and deaths over time
- Compare daily new cases between countries
- Compute death rate: `total_deaths / total_cases`

**Visuals:**
- 📈 Line charts
- 📊 Bar charts
- 🔥 Heatmaps (optional)

**Tools:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

---

### 5️⃣ Visualizing Vaccination Progress

**Goal:** Analyze global vaccine rollout.

**Tasks:**
- Plot cumulative vaccinations over time
- Compare % vaccinated population

**Charts:**
- Line charts
- Pie charts (optional)

---

### 6️⃣ 🌍 Optional: Build a Choropleth Map

**Goal:** Map COVID-19 impact across countries.

**Tools:** `plotly.express`, `geopandas` (optional)

**Tasks:**
- Prepare a dataframe with `iso_code`, `total_cases`
- Plot a choropleth map showing case or vaccination rates

---

### 7️⃣ Insights & Reporting

**Goal:** Communicate key findings.

**Tasks:**
- Write 3–5 key insights
- Highlight patterns or anomalies
- Document findings in Markdown cells or export to PDF

**Deliverables:**
- A complete Jupyter Notebook with:
  - ✅ Code
  - ✅ Visualizations
  - ✅ Narrative explanation

---
